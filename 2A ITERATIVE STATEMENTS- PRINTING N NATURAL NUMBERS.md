## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING NUMBERS FROM M TO N

###  Aim
To write a Python Program to print numbers range from M to N (including M and N values).
###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Read two integer inputs from the user and store them in m and n.
3. Use a for loop to iterate from m to n (inclusive).
4. In each iteration, print the current value of i.
5. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#Reg.NO- 212223060305
#Name-Vishnu Priya E
m=int(input())
n=int(input())
for i in range(m,n+1):
    print(i)
```

### RESULT
The program displays all integers from m to n, each on a new line.
